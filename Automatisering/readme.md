# Descrtiption: 

This is a repository with simple python projects that automates everyday task. 

Each .py file does something different to help save time and boost efficency. 

With the rise of AI such as ChatGPT and CoPilot, many of these tasks can be done 
without theese scripts. 

Theese scripts, however, are in some cases even more timesaving when used properly. 

This repository is part of my journy learning python and automation on my spare time.
